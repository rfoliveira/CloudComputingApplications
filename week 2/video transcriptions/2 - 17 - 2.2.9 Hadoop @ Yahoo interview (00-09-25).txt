We're sitting here with
Matt Ahrens from Yahoo.
Matt, what do you do at Yahoo?
>> So I'm an engineering manager
in our data systems group, and so
I help work on some of the large scale
data pipelines that help solve some of our
systems issues for advertisers and
our audience use cases.
>> What is the data pipeline inside Yahoo?
How many gigabytes per minute?
How many terabytes per day?
>> Yeah, so right now,
if you're right across all of our
data systems that's trying
to handle all this data,
we're probably in the order of
hundreds of terabytes a day.
So definitely many gigabytes per
minute that we're trying to process.
>> And is the data all uniform or
what does it look like?
>> It depends on the specific platform and
system that the data is
trying to process for.
But some of our data, you know advertising
data, will have events that range from
a kilobyte or two to a few hundred bytes
from even ad click or ad conversion.
Then some of our audience data,
we have more weblog data that
could be many kilobytes of data.
Now we do try to structure our data and
have schemas for it, and
we've been moving to avro as our standard
schema format for our data systems.
>> So tell us about the data in more
detail, I mean there's what, four,
no five V's, six Vs.
Velocity, veracity, volume, and
I can't remember the other two.
>> Yeah, [LAUGH] I don't remember
them either, so that's fine.
Yeah, I mean, I think in terms when you
talk about our data, it's definitely not
homogenous, right, it's very heterogeneous
even inside a given platform, right.
That a given advertising platform for
example, the way that we process ad
impressions could be very different
than the way we process ad pixels.
And so we also set up our systems to
handle streams in a different manner.
So that's both on a Hadoop and
on our other real time systems.
And that we're willing to process things
independently that make sense for
that type of event that
makes up the transaction.
>> They're all mixed together
in the incoming stream, and
then you have to sort
them out into different.
>> Yes, so actually, at the front end of
the pipeline, yeah they're all gobbled
together essentially in sets of files that
could have different types of events.
And so each event though will have some,
in the header or
some other part of the front end of the
schema, it'll have what event type it is.
And so that's our marker to use to say
okay, we know this is an impression or
we know this is a pixel, and because of
that we'll process it in a different way.
>> And so what's the range of times
you've got to be able to do this,
as a sort of arriving of the data to
the actually processing of the data, and
someone using it?
>> Yeah, so most of our data is coming
in from our kind of collection system,
it's coming in, in a couple minutes.
So after, in Hadoop we process
five minute batches, so
after that five minute batch closes,
after a few minutes, then,
we start doing our transformation
aggregation validation jobs.
And so the time format varies on system,
wow much system complexity
we have built in, but usually in
the order 30 minutes to 90 minutes.
We'll finish all those stages to
process that five minutes of data and
make it available for downstream.
>> So, time is money.
>> How much is ten minutes or
that time scale?
What's that worth to a company?
>> You know, I don't think I
can give exact dollars, but
that certainly is the case where
the faster we can deliver data,
especially the feedback
systems internally.
An example use case is our ad servers
keep track of campaign budgets.
And we don't want to overspend or
underspend.
So the sooner we can give feedback to our
ad servers to tell them like hey, just to
let you know, this campaign has reached
its budget, then they won't accidentally
overspend for them, and they could give it
to another campaign that could make money.
So there definitely is value in us
providing data as quickly as possible, but
I'm not sure the exact
dollar amounts per minute.
>> Very exciting stuff though.
Okay.
So let's move on to Yahoo.
We're teaching open source Hadoop and
so on.
But you know what does Yahoo
get out of open source?
because you use these software.
So?
>> Yeah I mean obviously Yahoo was
the creator of Hadoop and it chose to open
source Hadoop, so it obviously believes
in open source and that community.
And obviously Yahoo, really since
I've been at Yahoo for eight years,
we've continually invested in open source,
both contributing and
also building some of our platforms
on open source solutions.
So I think the strategy
there is acknowledging that
there's a great momentum in
the community of these technologies.
There's so many people in the
industry,both private and public sectors,
that want to solve these same problems,
and we could get
other people working on them, and
we don't have all the solutions, right.
We don't have all the talent in the world.
So we can get input from other people,
get feedback from them on what can work,
and we're going to add value
to that platform as a whole.
And so that's why we believe in
open source and investing in it.
>> Well it's a great attribute for
education,
because we can actually use
the tools the industry's using.
So, very cool.
Careers.
I'd like to sort of pick your brain on
how do people get started in big data,
in cloud computing?
[SOUND] how did you get started?
>> Yeah, no, that's a good question.
I came over from working on embedded
software at Motorola to move to Yahoo and
working on large scale database systems.
So it just happened with that job move
to get thrown into this world and
I can tell you, I absolutely love it.
I think this is really the center
of the software industry right now,
is solving these large
scale data problems.
I would recommend, I think there's
a couple things I can think of for
younger people who are looking
to get into this area.
One is, I would say start playing
with these technologies, right.
I mean with open source and
all the other resources online,
is you can start building
in these systems yourself.
Even if you only have a single server, or
if you want to use some cloud resource
to set up a cluster for cheap.
That you should build your own solution in
terms of managing a cluster of Hadoop or
some other system, and
try it out yourselves.
In terms of how to actually
build the data application,
I always tell people to find
a passion area when it comes to data.
You know some people might be interested
in doing sports analytics, or
healthcare research or some other industry
that they're already passionate about.
And try to connect that to big data.
To try to find some open
source data sets that they can
put into their system they're building and
actually try to solve a problem.
You know,
ask a question with these large data sets.
What could I mine in terms of
some patterns of health care.
Put into a Hadoop or some other data set,
run some queries, build a solution and
you'll find in solving that problem you're
going to start learning what it means to
be a data engineer.
What it means to use these
big data technologies.
>> When you sort of, in Yahoo when you're
hiring people, what are you looking for?
>> You know, it obviously depends on
where they're at in their career.
Obviously, people who coming out of
school, we're looking for their pedigree
in terms of what they've done in school,
in terms of their classwork and projects.
But we're also looking for
people who built stuff, right?
So that can be anything from internships
to on the side or involved in campus
groups, people who actually built
something that they're passionate about.
That's what we want to see is people
who actually are passionate about
building these systems, and it's not just
about having a job and getting paid, but
they're actually interested in
this type of stuff day to day.
because thats what we found to be
the most successful engineers.
Those who just have a built in
passion to working with data and
solving these large scale
problems that we face everyday.
>> Okay, where do you see
careers in this area going?
I mean you're in there.
10 years time, Wwat do you expect?
>> I think that with the rise of open
source, and all these proliferation of
options, in these large-scale
data platforms, I think there's
going to be probably two main areas
that are really going to be invested in.
One of these is actually
building these platforms and
making them enterprise ready.
So you've already seen some
companies rise up, who actually,
are participanting in the open source
community then also offer solutions for
big companies adopting those technologies.
So I think that's going to
become more prominent, right.
These companies that can not only
contribute to open source but
also be a bridge to companies that
want to use those technologies
to offer consultation services and
training.
>> So a big swath of different interests.
>> Yeah, because so many industries are
going to start adopting these technologies
and all of them are going to want
help in how to make use of that.
So that's one area.
The second area I see is really
people who can look at big data and
not just make it available, but
actually ask the right questions,
figure out how to query in the right way,
and build models,
data mining solutions on top of that to
actually provide value for the business.
Because if you just have big data,
that sounds great, but
it doesn't actually add
any value to the company.
You need people who go in and actually
ask the right questions of the data,
pull the right information on the data
to inject value back into the business.
So the people who can do that are going to
be very valuable going forward.
>> So, mid-career individuals and
they want get into the big data.
So, they should start playing with
sort of developing interests.
Any other sort of suggestions?
>> Another great thing too,
just to get your name out there,
is just start contributing to
an open source technology, right.
You can go to a lot of
the Apache projects,
you can look at the issue boards,
start with some small bugs.
Just, try to do a simple bug ticket and
start contributing, and
then see where that takes you.
Maybe you'll find yourself really
interested in participating.
You can start networking,
connecting to other people in the industry
that work on that technology.
>> I guess on the can't side, you might
also say, and get interested perhaps you
should have a blog on sports and
publish some of your analysis.
>> Yeah, that's another great way.
Yeah, if you're actually providing that,
answering those questions and
finding insights, yeah.
Make those publicly available and
try to network with people
who are doing the same thing.
>> So sort of build up a portfolio?
>> Yeah, yep.
>> Okay, terrific.
Thank you very much.
>> Thanks.
