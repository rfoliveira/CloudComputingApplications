In this video,
we will talk about the ApplicationMaster.
Remember that in Yarn,
you have resource manager that
only knows about resources.
It's just one entity overseeing
the cluster's resource usage.
We have node managers that each one
sits on top of one physical box,
basically manage the containers
running on the node.
The node manager and
both of the resource manager,
none of them know anything about
what's going inside the containers.
It could be a Hadoop task, it could be
a Storm task, it could be anything.
It could be a web server task,
they don't know.
They only care about this is a container
that needed such and such resources.
Five CPUs, 200 gigabytes of disk space,
five gigabytes of RAM.
This is all those two
components know about.
ApplicationMaster, on
the other hand is the entity
that knows what's happening
inside the containers.
It knows that there's
an application running.
It knows it's Hadoop,
therefore it needs map tasks,
it needs reduced tasks,
it needs to do shuffle.
It needs to move data from
these components into this
other set of components.
Therefore, the ApplicationMaster is
the component that schedules and
monitors the application in stance itself.
It's only the ApplicationMaster
that knows if a task is hung.
If there's no progress in the task itself,
for
example the map task of Hadoop,
of map reduce.
So, for
example if a node manager is involved,
it just sees there's a container.
There is a program running.
Is it hung?
It doesn't know, and it doesn't care.
It's only the ApplicationMaster
that knows this.
So, since it's the ApplicationMaster
that has this information,
it can also heartbeat to resource manager.
Right?
It can gather information from all
of the tasks running on the cluster
and figure out if there is progress
happening in the application.
And if it decides that, it sends
a heartbeat to the resource manager
that it indicates the liveliness
of the whole application.
It can request new containers
through heartbeats or
receive acknowledgement for
allocated containers.
And then it can go say, okay, I needed
five new containers, now resource manager
tells me that such and such nodes
are ready to give me containers.
Now I can go and talk to those boxes and
get my containers to launch more
map tasks or more reduce tasks.
Finally, the ApplicationMaster
provides an optional tracking
URL when it registers as a new
application with the resource manager.
It's a proxy URL provided by resource
manager when the application is submitted.
Which makes it easy for the user to
find an application instance, right.
So remember that a Yarn
cluster could be running.
Hundreds of or
maybe thousands of Hadoop applications.
And you really want to know, okay,
what's the user wants to know
what's happening to my application.
All right?
That's how this mechanism,
the proxy URL that resource
manager gives you when
you're stopping an app,
gives you a view into
your own application,
which really goes and
talks to the ApplicationMaster.
And then this URL can be updated
when you are un-registering
an application to point
to a history servers.
So when your application is done,
your map reduce program is done.
It updates this URL,
there's no application master anymore,
there is a history server that can say,
okay for now,
these logs that were
aggregated by note manager for
a certain application,
the application is not alive anymore.
Let's move the logs to a history server
and update the URL to point to those logs.
