So
Amazon Web Services are probably
the largest IAS provider.
They will provide a whole gamut
of infrastructure as a service,
from storage, S3 Elastic Block Storage,
computation, Elastic Cloud Computing.
They have databases, RDS, Dynamo,
ElastiCache coordination.
And they provide a simple workflow
framework for doing jobs, building jobs.
All of their services
are paid depending on use.
There is an offshoot
of their marketing and
sales operations, and
it's grown to be one of the more dominant,
well, the dominant characteristic
of Amazon, that it provides this
IaaS solution and there's a lot
of different companies that use
the bill on top of IaaS to build
their own services, cloud services.
So if you look at the Amazon Web Services,
there's perhaps four
main places that they
really sort of excel.
One is the Amazon EC2 environment, which
allows you to create virtual machines and
populate the virtual machines, create
networks between the virtual machines,
and then use those virtual machines
as a distributive system for
whatever purpose you care to choose.
Amazon DynamoDB is
a database that's flexible.
It's a NoSQL database.
So it's very fast and has,
as we will find out,
it sort of uses eventual consistency.
We will discuss that later but
this allows it to have lots of
customers very fast response time and
still cope with a huge
amount of information.
There is a service that runs code in
response to events through the Lambda.
And what will would do is, automatically
manage how your systems respond
to different activities,
different requests,
different responses when you have
computer resource failures and so on.
And then Amazon S3 is their very
large storage, long term storage.
It's very scalable and provides a great
deal of reliability and tolerance.
It stores things in terms of objects,
and you can retrieve those objects and
use them.
So, for example,
when you're using Amazon EC2,
you may want some data out of storage.
You would go your Amazon S3 to retrieve
that storage, and then you would use it in
EC2 to provide whatever computing
you actually want to do.
Amazon's split up into local regions,
these are just a list of them.
There are three main facilities
in the United States.
East, West and West again.
One up in Oregon one down in California.
Of course Amazon's located up in Oregon,
so that makes it easy.
There are however Amazon regions
in the rest of the world, so
there's one in Frankfurt,
one in Ireland, one in Singapore,
one in Tokyo, one in Sydney,
one in Sao Paulo.
So they have a set of distributed
facilities that they can direct you to,
and whenever you sign up for
Amazon services,
what you will be directed to,
is one of those regional areas.
And they will be providing your compute
for you, so that you benefit from a low
latency and
high availability In your particular area.
Different Types of Instances
can be created inside
the infrastructures as a service.
So we mentioned the EC2, if you dig
down into the EC2, what you can do is,
to create micro instances of virtual
machines, which are sort of small
very lightweight virtual machines,
they're still virtual machines.
It's a free tier, meaning that students
can actually get access to those and
use those for their own personal projects.
And there are multiple Micro Instances
running at the same time.
They do not put an awful lot of effort for
multi-tenancy, to make sure that
the clients don't interfere with
each other, but they are free.
So, in general terms,
you can actually get a lot of compute out
of those micro instances,
small virtual machines that fit
together into their big agile
hardware infrastructures.
General Purpose machines,
those are larger instances they use for
production for large companies
wanting to provide services.
They have memory optimization, storage
optimization, compute optimization.
And if you want to,
you can actually get GPU instances
in those general purpose machines.
So if you' want to run some floating
point, there's ways to accelerate that and
really take advantage of
GPUs in the computations.
Amazon has typically $4 billion
to $5 billion range revenue.
That was 2014.
And it's sort of been doubling
over a two year period,
despite continuous decrease in prices.
So this is quite an achievement,
and Amazon is the target to beat,
it's the company to beat if you're
trying to provide IaaS facilities,
it provides the main source of
competition for everybody else.
It's capacity is about ten
times as large as it's
nearest 145 competitors,
that's a Gartner figure.
But, that again, is very impressive if you
think about the scale of some of these
machines and scale of operations.
Even Google doesn't threaten
Amazon's IaaS services.
They really sort of dominate.
What do they provide?
Well, they runing on Xen Hypervisors.
They're a proprietary form version of Xen,
so
it's been modified internally
at Amazon to be more efficient.
Micro instances are often oversubscribed.
The other systems as I said earlier,
weren't, so if you want to sort of
get free computation, as long as you
don't mind sort of a little bit of
performance hit occasionally,
those micro instances are very cool.
Storage and local area networks
are shared, they're multi-tenant, so
you are sort of losing
out if there's lots of
customers wanting to use
a particular Amazon service.
You will notice a performance degradation,
but
on the other hand, they're trying to
provide really effective designs where
that impact of sharing
is not felt too badly.
You get billed by the hour.
And there's provisions for
Amazon's machine instances licenses.
You don't have to worry about them.
So, let's suppose that you
want to use Microsoft Word,
they will provide you the images for
Microsoft Word, and you can use them.
You do not have to go and
get separate licenses or
if you want to use some other
proprietary operating system.
Typically, Amazon will provide
you those machine images and
have it all licensed ready to go for you.
The operating system is
typically on outwards is
the customer problem but
Amazon provides you a lot of choices.
They have an image store, for example, for
their virtual machines and you choose that
image store which operating system that
they provide that you would like to use.
Now if you want use your own operating
system you can actually do so,
you are just required to upload
that into the Amazon system.
And then their imaging software would
allow you to boot that particular image.
It would be booted on top
of the Xen Hypervisor.
We have consoles here on the Amazon stuff.
The consoles are there to provide
management for what you're doing, whether
it be virtual machines or whether it be
and some sort of platform as a service.
They have different types of consoles.
The main one controlling the virtual
machines is provided by VMWARE.
They do also provide one by Microsoft.
The storage.
Well, it's transient, instance-specific
storage, so when you start up
your virtual machines in EC2 you get
access to storage as part of that.
But it's transient because when your
virtual machine is not running,
that storage then disappears.
It's taken down, and
moved to the bigger store, the S3 store.
There's persistent instance-independent
elastic block storage,
and you also have SSD and
encryption options.
The block store can be use
to build other types of
database systems as we
will find out later on.
The SSDs use because it
really does accelerate your
computations make them faster.
Encryption allows you to actually say
provide heifer environment on top of
Amazon or
a storage at rest encrypted solution.
And so, it provides you safety and
security.
You just need to build it on
top of the infrastructure.
The object-based Simple Storage Service,
S3, is therefore all your
long term storage needs.
It stores objects, you can put images into
it, data into it, all sorts of things.
The major cost you'll get is uploading and
downloading to that S3 from,
let's suppose you want to
upload it from your business,
then that will be the big costs
in trying to get data there.
The data itself is located per region,
and so when you create data,
you have to say which region, well usually
it's assumed which region you're going to
be in, because that will be the closest
one, and the data stays there.
So if you build a data
that you want to keep
in the United States, it's not going
to actually to be transferred abroad.
It will be restricted to
the reasons you put it in and so
that's safety mechanism.
If want to actually back it up across
regions, you can actually do so
and the provide another
service to do that.
On the networking side,
they provide a virtual private net cloud
Private routing between
the virtual private clouds.
They provide you VPN tunnels that can
connect your enterprise into Amazon.
So you build your virtual cloud and
you connect your VPN tunnel into it.
And there are sort of
direct connects that allow
customers to use carrier based WANS,
private WAN services.
So if you for example, negotiate with
AT&T to have a high bandwidth connection,
you can use that as your carrier, and
get into Amazon services, and
use that to connect to your cloud as well.
And that's a big advantage if you're
negotiating with these large companies for
the carrier access.
When you log in to Amazon,
what you'll see is this splash screen.
It's pretty self explanatory,
there's lots of documentation.
As I say, as a student,
you can do this for free.
They don't need a credit card from you.
But then for free,
you can have $300 worth of compute,
and these are all the sort of ways
that you can use that compute.
You can go in there at any
one of these points and
start operating and
building up your service.
The next main splash screen is this one.
What it shows you is all the different
services that Amazon can actually provide.
And I've only touched on
a small number of them.
There are actually a huge,
huge number of them and
they'll range enterprise, mobile services,
application services, analytics.
Just depending upon what you run.
And Amazon will let you
build the various systems.
Some of these will be platforms and
service.
Some of them will be
infrastructure as service.
But you're starting off as infrastructure
service layering things up and
then providing that for your customers.
And Amazon's going to provide all the load
balancing to get at your systems.
So it's all sort of very straightforward
and very well thought out.
And Amazon is one of the lead companies in
actually doing this type of interface and
providing this type of service stretcher,
which is why they're so successful.
So, this diagram just shows you some
of the other screens you can get to.
This one is showing you the resources.
It's showing you how many
running instances, the volumes.
That's up here.
How many key pairs or security
keys that you're using with
what sort of groups you've got.
Whether you're losing elastic IP, meaning
you can have a range of IP addresses and
increase them or decrease them.
What sort of, let's see this one.
Low balance, so you're using what
the options are in the low balancer.
So, when you see this,
what you can do is to see the different
health of the different systems.
And you notice under here,
it lists some of the different zones.
The ones you're probably interested in.
US West, USE East and gives some, well
actually in this case just US West but
it gives you some details about their
accessibility and availability.
Here's another [INAUDIBLE]
this is if you're going
in to build a system, then you can
choose your own machine image.
Amazon provides AMIs and
you can choose what from those
AMIs which particular type of operating
system you would like say as a Linux.
And down here is a server, and
down here is a Windows Server.
You can just opt to select one of these.
You can say whether you want a 64-bit or
a 32-bit and
that all is provided for
you in building your services.
And so here is yet
another screen set to building your Cloud.
What you would like to do is to say
whether you want big virtual machines or
small virtual machines.
Well here's a list of all
the virtual machines they provide.
And you can see that they
have micro instances,
they have large instances,
they have extra large,
general purpose sort of
IaaS infrastructure.
There's dots for
selecting which one you want.
Here's a number of virtual CPUs,
do you want, per instance,
so you can choose a micro with one, or
you can choose an extra large with four or
up eight, if you want.
You can choose how much memory.
Now, you notice these
are all in categories.
They're basically whether you want to do a
lot of computing or whether you want to do
a small amount of computing, whether you
want to pay a lot of money or you don't.
So there's various options for the memory
and they fit to the number of CPUs.
There's optimized availability for
some of the optimization packages.
And then you can also specify how
much network traffic you want.
If you want to go to higher networking,
because you're using a lot of
network transfers, then you have
to go to a larger machine and
you have to pick one of
these options lower down.
You see,
you can even pick a 10 Gigabit dedicated,
this one 10 Gigabit dedicated
infrastructure, if you so desire.
So, that's yet another screen.
If you're building a system,
you go through various steps,
that would have been step three.
So you go on to step four, five, six.
Here's step seven,
cutting a lot of corners short, but
what we're going to do is to launch
the virtual machines we've built,
what we've done is to build a network
around them, and then we're going to sort
of just say, well, create these things.
So in step seven, we're reviewing
what we're going to launch.
It's going to be a micro.
And you have a networking preference.
And we have the security group.
The security group would also indicate how
you connect to it, typically using SSH,
and you're running over the protocol,
TCPs.
So, you get a nice, good, constant,
fixed connection into your machine,
and it's encrypted, so nobody can
actually interfere with what's going on.
And then, after you press Launch,
you will get a launch status,
and it will tell you after
a little bit of time that your
systems are all running, and
you can go to another monitor,
which you can actually sort of look at the
health of those systems you've launched.
See the overhead, the CPU being used.
The amount of disc being used.
And so, lots and lots of different things.
Here, you see a button to actually
go off and see the instances.
That's more of a summary.
But you can drill down and
see lots of details about them.
If you do pick that summary,
this is what you're getting.
As you can see, the status is running.
And you can see a little bit
of detail about where we are.
It's still initializing.
Well, the machine's up,
it's got a public DNS, it's
got a public IP address, so
you can reach it from outside.
So you have there a sort of
step-by-step set of slides,
set of displays, that will allow you to
go and launch your own personal cloud.
This quick overview of what we've
seen inside Amazon Web Services, and
it provides a very comprehensive
set of tours, the building,
everything from IaaS up.
And you can launch your own PAS,
if you want, and some people do that.
Amazon is one of the, well, it is the top
rated largest cloud provider for IaaS.
And now we'll go and
have a look at some others.
