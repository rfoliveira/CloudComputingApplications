Welcome to the very first lesson of
the cloud application class,
we're going to start off talking
about cloud computing,
the motivation for it.
And then describe a little bit of
what you're going to see later
on in the rest of the course.
We're very excited to be giving
this to you to be frank.
This has taken us a while to put together,
it's gathered from lots
of different sources.
And what we've tried to do is
to condense it for you and
to make it much more personalized
to your own career goals.
So we're excited,
because this has real impact in the world.
This is going to change the world and
we're excited for you.
We would like you to join in
this revolution, this change.
We would like you to be in control
to have mastery of this new area.
And I think by the end of the lecture,
by the end of the series,
you are going to have some skills that
will really set you apart and allow
you to participate in what is happening
in the computer industry right now.
So tremendous buzz.
Let's look at what people are saying
about cloud computing or had said.
So the first is Nicholas Carr,
he's written a book.
A very important book
about cloud computing and
sort of epitomizes what's going
on by saying, revolution.
It's the biggest upheaval since
the invention of the PC back in the 1970s.
IT departments will have
little to do once the bulk
of business, computing,
shifts to the cloud.
This is a real dramatic statement and
we'll try and
give you some ideas about why
Nicholas Carr actually said that.
If you go over to the money
side of the world,
cloud computing also has lots of impact.
And money control has
written domestic cloud
computing is estimated to grow at 53%.
Now what we’ll see is that
growth has mainly happened.
That what we’re reaching now is
a different level of performance
in terms of growth, but it is enormous and
it has affected industry.
So let’s move on to the first slide and
what I want to talk to
you about really is.
If you have computing, why would you
go and consider cloud computing?
There's a number of
arguments you can make.
Those arguments really evolve around
economics and costs ease of use.
If you own your own information systems,
well, you've got control of everything.
You can set your own agendas.
You can do whatever you want on those
machines, but you have to pay for them.
There's a capital investment.
As soon as you pay that capital,
you are paying out interest payments.
So if you're doing a startup,
that capital investment is big and
looks bad for you.
There are heavy fixed costs.
You have to have a building,
you have to have air conditioning,
you have to have power,
you have to have staff to run it.
So those heavy fixed costs you've
got to consider in your equation for
your business.
There's redundant expenditures,
you are going to have to pay for
people to work on this.
You're going to have to pay for
programmers,
you're going to have lots of overlapping
duties, because you'll have to
have more than one person doing
each of things for redundancy.
You're going to have to have backups, all
of those costs will affect your business.
Next, energy costs.
Everybody talks nowadays about
the high price of energy and
carbon neutral and
trying to be sustainable.
Well, energy cost for cloud is high.
You don't get that much
CPU utilization for
the amount of energy you're putting in.
Reason you want computing to be,
you picked this, you want it to be
easy to use there when you need it, but
you're not going to be using it 100%.
And so it is more expensive,
then dealing with unreliable hardware.
We're going to be talking about
scaling things up, making things big.
Taking lots and lots of computing,
putting it on machines.
Lots of data and
spreading it across lots of machines.
We're going to be using cuts, custom.
Well, consumer off the shelf type
of hardware, because it's cheaper.
But if you have 10,000 PCs, well,
one PC might work very
well in your house Us.
But 10,000 PCs, they have a failure rate
one out of every, well once or
twice every year.
When you put 10,000 together in one room,
you're going to see lots of
those machines die every hour.
So unreliable hardware
means you're going to have
to retrace your route
doing lots of maintenance.
Last, you have lots of capacity.
What are you going to use it for?
When you're not using it,
it's just not going to sit there idle,
warming up your site.
Is technology labor going into this?
All of that is a constant, but
your use of the computing is variable.
So bottom line on this,
if you are a corporate and
you're using your own
computing facilities.
It really isn't sustainable
in the modern age.
So let's go back a bit.
We'll go back to 1961.
Cloud computing has been predicted.
It's been predicted by many people.
One of the most famous people is
John McCarthy inventor of LISP,
which was an early programming language.
What he said was computing is someday
going to be organized as a public utility,
just as the telephone system is
organized as a public utility,
obviously, back in 61.
Nowadays, it's sort of
morphed into cellular.
So we would like
to build our future and
incorporate this notion of
utility computing and
the cloud is the first step to that.
So what is a cloud?
This diagram is produced from
a description by NIST or
what cloud computing is.
And what I'm going to do is to describe
all the various parts of it and
give you some examples.
So first of all, the cloud is out there.
Anybody can use it from anywhere.
So availability is good and
accessibility is good.
It really becomes a ubiquitous
computing environment.
It's convenient,
24/7 you don't have to turn it off,
turn it back on, whatever,
it's always running for you.
And because of all of the input from
all the industries into Cloud Computing,
it's becoming very convenient to use.
You want to use it?
Well, you've got on-demand access.
Now supposing you got clients,
you got, let's say, 100 clients.
You're a start-up.
Instant access, they can use it.
What about 10,000 clients?
What about a million clients?
It's the same story.
You have on-demand,
across the network, to that cloud,
to deliver the services
that your company produces.
It could be rapidly provisioned.
You want to start up a website,
you want to start a database,
you can sit down at a console
mapped into that Cloud Computing,
and create one of these applications
in ten minutes, half an hour.
Have it up and running,
decide what size it should be.
Scale it up if you've got it wrong.
That's what's meant by rapid provisioning.
So, your IT business,
the business you are selling
to the public, can be rapidly
released with minimal management.
Lots of convenient software
to configure it and so on.
And it can give you early, or it can
give you service provider interaction,
with sort of communicating
with those services,
getting those services linked in to all
the different other subsystems you have.
All that is facilitated in this cloud.
So let's look inside the cloud.
You have various pieces.
You have a network.
Typically you're going to have a data
center switch and then switches and
then ethernet to all the different
computers in the cloud.
You're going to have servers and
they're going to be connected by ethernet.
They're going to be where
you do all your work.
They're probably going to
be multi-processors and
they probably have lots of memory.
You have storage.
That storage is shared between
all of those machines.
It's optimized to give you best
bandwidth from a server to the storage,
we won't discuss that now.
We will come back to that and revisit it.
But that sort of network itself has to
be managed and maintained better for
the customer just to delegate
that to the cloud producer.
Then you have the set of
services you wanted to provide.
And we're going to talk
about stacked services.
There's not just one service,
there's a whole set of layers of
service that are really crucial
to building the type of enterprise
you'd want to have your public view.
Then on the side of that,
we have all of the applications, and
the applications can
radically be different.
So we can talk about web services.
So if you want a website, they deliver
10,000 pay dues a second or whatever,
you can build your app so it's on multiple
machines, but it's on one web engine.
And web requests come into that cloud,
they're going to get load balanced
across all the servers and
those servers are all going to be
coordinated to give you that web presence.
So that's one part.
You could have search, and
of course pretty much everybody's
familiar with search.
You issue a request,
the search engine goes away,
looks at all of its stored data and
comes back with the top 10,000,
20,000 recommendations.
Search is really powerful.
It's really very, very fast.
What's happening is, you get
the request coming in from outside,
it's fed to an appropriate server,
that server looks at the request,
decides how its going to execute.
Maybe it decides it should
be a distributive query and
gets multiple servers to work with it.
They will look at the databases,
all the files, produce all the results and
then the particular server you
contacted will return your results.
All that under the cover,
very easy to use for
the customer, very easy to use for
the search provider.
Other applications are email,
email nowadays is done in the same way.
Google mail, for example, is typical,
where you can serve huge numbers,
millions of people, email off of cloud and
you can have very good.
Facilities like spam removal and so
on because it's all centralized,
it can all be managed.
Facebook, we can build social networks.
We can have interaction between people.
We can have picture,
videos, all sorts of things
because we've centralized all those
facilities and we share them.
So Office has always
been Microsoft's power
in the way it produces computers and
the software for computers.
Well, they've produced Office 365, so
you can your office on the cloud
now instead of at home.
So any device, mobile or otherwise,
can access your own Office,
use your Office.
So if you have a small company,
and you're sharing documents,
Office365 makes it a real necessity.
Google Docs.
Similar sort of offering.
Other applications allow
you to do all sorts of
similar things to Office, but
now it's a separate entity.
But it's organized the same way.
So backing off a second.
Let's just step back.
What we're doing is
something really novel,
we're discussing a really novel issue.
Cloud Computing is providing
all of those facilities.
It's providing it, very,
very conveniently, very economically, and
it's simple for the enterprise to use.
It's simple for the customers to use.
And that is the attraction
of Cloud Computing.
So let's talk about the excitement
that cloud computing has created.
Gartner has a Hype Cycle,
which is a good way of representing
excitement from the community.
And what you see in this
diagram is steady growth from
the invention of cloud
computing to a maximum.
And then it's going to drop as people
realize what it's good for and
what it isn't good for.
And then it climbs back up as people
build on all the successes of cloud and
actually make it a viable enterprise
type of enhancing product.
We start off and we move forward to
a peak of inflated, expectations.
This occurred about 2011 when
Carl was writing his book.
From there there's only down,
you might say.
What people discovered was there's
privacy, there's security problems,
there's just the problems of being able
to interact with lots of software.
What you see happen is
a drop in discussions,
in excitement about cloud computing.
And about 2014 we sort of reached
the bottom of that trough.
It was still pretty high discussion rate.
But people realized there are limitations.
We need to fix those, and
we also need to move the cloud,
the things that are working well,
into massive production.
And that's what you see on this
diagram beginning to happen.
You notice the slope is up.
If we move to this year, what you see
is we move from the bottom and
we start rising.
And now, pretty much everybody's
accepted that if they are going to
have an Enterprise ID they're
going to put it on the cloud.
Now, it doesn't stop there.
If we look forward into the future and
start looking at our tea leaves,
making predictions, we see
that actually companies are making plans
to move heavily into the cloud industry.
This is really where
people have understood
what cloud computing means to the world.
What I want to talk to you
now about is how the services
of the cloud get delivered
to the customer.
And there's basically three different
ways, three different models for delivery.
Let's look at infrastructure as a service.
There what we're doing is to provide
computer hardware in terms of
processors, disks, network.
We are allowing people to use
those services, to rent them.
We're providing a infrastructure as
a service that you can go to, you
can declare how many computers you want,
what are the hardware facilities you want.
Then it is up to you to put your
own software on top of that system,
even your own operating
system on top of that system.
And you just provide your
customers with all that
software, but you've rented the hardware.
The next level is Platform as a Service,
PaaS.
Here what you're doing is deploying
customer-created applications.
So the applications are running on what
you're providing in terms of operating
system and hardware, as a cloud provider.
So, App Engine is an example.
Google provides App Engine, you write
your application with App Engine.
And all of a sudden,
you can run from 1 to however many,
200,000, 600,000 machines on Google.
Then we have Software as a Service.
Here what we're using is
the user's applications,
we're providing the user
applications over a network and
they would just interact
with those applications.
So for example, if you're doing email,
if you're doing Office 365,
there are companies out
there that are making huge
amounts of money out of
providing services to customers.
And one of them is SalesForce.
What SalesForce does,
it provides customer relationship
management software, amongst others.
It tailors that, it has a whole suite of
software that allow customers to pick and
choose particular forms of CRM,
or whatever,
and allows them to use that for
their businesses.
We talked about synergy.
One of the bigger issues that
I want to get across is that we're just
not on the entry level of clouds or
even just on this rise of enlightenment.
There is a lot of things happening that
really make cloud computing very exciting.
This synergy is best looked at
just what sort of interests
over time ever happen, what are the news
events, what are the discussion points?
Now, we talked about Big Data and
virtualization.
If I plot those, in time you'll
see how they're interacting.
The first is,
we have a virtualization effort.
Just here, rising up and creating all
sorts of potential possibilities.
Then what we see is cloud
computing overtaking that,
using it, to build an infrastructure,
we've talked about the different
ways that can be delivered.
And that has been huge impact.
Now what we're seeing is
a rise in Big Data, and
Big Data is exploiting the cloud computing
to provide information for everyone.
Anyone can do analytics, essentially,
on massive amounts of data.
That is provoking a huge amount of change.
So Big Data, where will it take us?
Well, it's another revolution,
it's built on clouds.
The data collection's too large to
transmit economic clear of the Internet.
You're talking about
petabytes of collections.
The computation is data intensive,
lots of disks, networks, and CPUs.
The overhead of maintaining
cyber infrastructure for
that is very expensive, but
why not share it amongst the community?
So for example, Google Maps is a huge
infrastructure investment, but
it allows all sorts of businesses.
You're going to see smart cities building
on some of those infrastructures,
on some of the data collected for
smart cities.
Users buy Big Data services from
Clouds and they share the overhead.
So they're sharing out the cost of
putting all that Big Data together.
The essential part to all of this is here.
This Big data is going to be easy to use.
It's going to be easy
to write programs for.
It's going to provide
you fast turn around, so
you know what the economy's doing.
What the stock market is doing.
How do you do that?
You make programming very easy so
that programmers can easily deliver
those values to the community.
How do they do that?
We will be talking about some developments
on cloud computing that
allow this to occur.
They are MapReduce,
there are several other topics that we'll
come across but MapReduce is the main one.
We'll talk about time,
processing in real time.
But let's first just deal with MapReduce.
What's caused that to happen?
Why has MapReduce suddenly
become the focus of lots and
lots of Big Data computations?
Well, part of it's because
the applications are there.
The applications that implement
MapReduce like Hadoop.
The applications that allow you to
take one MapReduce operation and
combine it with multiple other like PIG.
The MapReduce operations
operate on the Big Data, but
the Big Data has to come from somewhere,
it has to come from storage.
So you're talking about storage systems.
HDFS is a distributed file store
which is reliable, redundant,
fault tolerant, and distributed,
and we'll be talking about HDFS.
You can use it with databases, and
HBase is an example of that,
distributed over multiple machines.
So you can make queries over
huge numbers of machines.
So today we've sort of introduced you to
the world of Big Data in our lecture.
What drives Cloud adoption?
Why Clouds make economic sense?
How Clouds support
the Big Data revolution?
Who benefits from Clouds?
Our course is now going to go off and look
at some of these questions in more detail.
We're going to start by
looking at the economics,
just why do Clouds rise as so
imperative for enterprises to
use in this sort of current day?
So on to the Economics of Clouds.
