In this set of slides,
what I want to do is to emphasize
just what do you get with OpenStack,
and what are the mechanisms that
allow you such great deal of control?
Sort of if you like diving a little into
OpenStack to give you a feeling of what
it's capable of doing.
So the OpenStack project's been around for
awhile.
It has a very sort of
ambitious goal of trying
to be ubiquitous where you're building
cloud infrastructures for everyone, and
Ken Pepple articulated
that in his statements.
Basically, he claims
OpenStack is an open source
software project enterprise services
providers can use to set up and
run their own cloud compute and
storage infrastructure.
So you've already seen
this diagram before,
I just want to now emphasize
the elements in here.
There's a dashboard, the dashboard
talks to all of the various elements.
I haven't put in the OpenStack controller
there, I've assumed that it is in there.
But what it's going to do, that controller
on the dashboard, they're going to map
to the compute networking storage elements
that you require for your OpenStack.
And now, you will have instantiated on
multiple nodes these compute elements,
and you probably have one networking
node that controls the network.
You probably have one storage node,
and maybe multiple storage nodes,
that control the storage.
When you ask the user
applications to come in,
you'll be allowing them to use
those compute, network, and
storage nodes to define what types
of Infrastructure they want.
Typically, for a set of users or
for a particular user application,
you'll be giving to that user
application a specific compute node.
Well, perhaps multiple nodes,
a specific network node and
specific storage nodes, so that that's
all sort of contained within the cloud.
The beauty is that when that
application is no longer needed,
you can just give it to somebody else.
You can give the hardware, the network,
the storage, to somebody else.
And then if you want to bring it
back later you can do the same.
If you want to scale it you can
release nodes if you want to, or
you can allocate nodes to make it bigger,
release nodes to scale it down.
So it gives you a great
deal of flexibility.
So that's the basic sort
of idea behind OpenStack.
Its compute server is called Nova,
it orchestrates large networks for
virtual machines and is responsible for
VM instance lifecycle, network management,
and user access control.
It has some storage,
which is called Swift,
provides a scalable redundant,
long-term storage for
things like virtual machine images,
data archives, and multimedia.
So these are basically, if you like,
sub-application, sub-components
of this whole OpenStack
infrastructure that allow you
to do different types of things.
This last one is an image server, and
when we are talking about boot images and
so on, this is what we're referring to,
what there is embedded into
the OpenStack architecture.
The ability to pick up virtual
machines from previous
operations, previous times that
OpenStack had been running, and
load those virtual machines and run those.
So you can, if you like, freeze
the OpenStack, store it away on your
Glance image server,
your files will be stored on the Swift.
This would all be done to the control
of Nova, and then when you want to
recreate this whole virtual data center,
what you can do is to talk to Nova,
you can pull out that image from Glance.
You can pull out the file
system from Swift.
They're all plugged together because
of the descriptions in Nova,
and so now you have a completely
working data center.
So you effectively can store and
retrieve data centers in
this whole sort of approach.
So what we've seen is this
development from a cloud,
just hardware, to being able to manage
the hardware with something like Mirantis.
To bringing up virtual clouds,
effectively,
that triple the compute,
the networking, and the storage.
To being able to manipulate that
cloud once it's actually running, and
that was this section with Nova, Swift,
and the network operating system.
So next time,
we'll be moving from there to some
cloud services and
talking about those cloud services.
Thank you.
