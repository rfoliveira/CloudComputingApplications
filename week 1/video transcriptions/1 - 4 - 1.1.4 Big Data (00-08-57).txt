This lecture is about Big Data.
It's a singular phrase, you might say.
We're looking at a collection
of data sets so large and so
complex it's impossible to
process it on one computer.
And it's impossible to process it
with the sort of usual databases and
tools that have existed for
the last 40 years in computer science..
Because of its size and complexity,
Big Data is hard capture.
It's hard to store, copy, delete.
There's privacy issues.
It's hard to search.
It's hard to share.
It's hard to analyze and
it's hard to visualize.
So it provides multiple
different challenges.
But, what it allows happen,
are all sorts of very, very good things.
So descriptions of Big Data.
I guess, if you want to look at
definitions, Big Data represents
the information assets that
are characterized by such a high volume.
It's high velocity,
you're getting lots of data in.
By the variety, all the different
types of data you're actually seeing.
And it requires specific technology and
analytical methods.
It gets transformed into values that are
worthwhile for society or for businesses.
So those aspects are generally becoming
accepted as to what Big Data means.
So what are the Challenges?
Well, moving into the internet of things,
we have a huge amount of
data on social networks.
We have instruments that record huge
amounts of information like the telescope.
So, all those devices, and
I've sort of listed them here,
Provide enormous amounts of data, and
some of those data, like cameras,
now produce 30,
40 megs just as a snapshot.
Medical data is going to
be a big leverage.
When you think of genomics and
its interaction,
you will see all sorts of possibilities
for huge amounts of data.
So, what do we want to do with this?
Well, that's this next piece,
this is a processing piece.
Analytics, but you gotta do analytics on
something, so you have to capture it,
you have to curate that data,
just like you curate books in library.
You need to search, share, you need to
store it, transfer, visual, visualize it,
because eyeballs are a lot more efficient
input processes for humans than just text.
And then you gotta protect
everybody's privacy.
What do we expect to get out of it?
This is if you like the gold.
What we're looking for is, predictive
analytics, so you can sit down and
say your company is
going to do this next year.
Or you can look at science and
say, oh, there's
some connection here, some correlation
here we need to investigate that.
Maybe there's a new physics law,
or people with this gene
are having this disease.
Maybe we should look at
how to fix that problem.
So it's doing predictive analysis.
Better decision making discovery.
What does it look like in terms of graphs?
Our growth in data has been
enormous over the last decade
and this is all happening
because of file computing,
because of ubiquity, the ease of
use of gathering that information.
You can see it outranks phones.
The way that cellular
phones have increased.
And it has outranked all sorts
of things including businesses.
It has really sort of grown tremendously,
exponential growth.
I'll give you an example of
how it's influencing bio.
So Bioinformatics, down in the 1980's,
we were sort of looking down
microscopes at slag gels and
sort of gathering data off those.
As we move forward till today,
we're analyzing huge proteins.
We're looking at DNA.
We're looking at all the implications of
life itself, in terms of information.
And so,
that has made a massive increase and
it allows discoveries that
just are unparalleled and
we're beginning to learn how to
approach things like cancer.
Astronomy's another example where
enormous amounts of data coming to us.
We start off down here back in the 70s,
and
really we were limited by our
IO devices and the storage.
Now, we're way up here.
We're inventing new telescopes.
We have new telescopes in the sky and
on land and
they're producing petabytes a day.
So that's a huge amount of information
to suck in, process and use.
And you would really like to go back and
look at all those astronomy databases
once you've got a whole sky surveyed.
Well, where are we going?
I'll give you some numbers, just so
you can see the exponential growth.
We've taken a lot of different examples
from a lot of different areas and stuck
them into one graph, but I want to just
sort of outline some key points on this.
So, we have a database of 150 species and
their genomes and
that takes up about just
below 16 terabytes of data.
If we looked today at social networks,
then Twitter and
all those crowd,
they're operating around that area or
maybe 3, 400 terabytes of information.
But as we go forward, we're going to
be sort of investigating very,
very complicated things like brains.
The human brain is way up in complexity,
millions and millions of vertices.
So that direction is what
we would like to get to.
So where's the future?
Well, we have scientists locally here,
Gene Robinson, for example.
What he would like to do is,
to combine DNA with RNA,
with proteins, neurons,
brain circuits, behavior.
So you could take a honey bee, And
you could have a model of a honey bee and
predict how it goes out and forages.
Put that into a computer, you can't.
Put that into a cloud, you can.
That could occupy all of
the machines today, but
we need to be able to do that
to understand how life occurs,
and how we can do optimizations.
And that applies not
only in the bios world,
but it has enormous implications
on economies and on businesses.
So, we have this scaling
of real-world entities.
Up here, right at the top, is our target.
We can't actually do this yet,
but this is where we're moving.
This is where we might be tomorrow.
This is where we are today.
