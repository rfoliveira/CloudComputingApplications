So, Google provides the best,
if you like, or the leading,
be careful what I say,
online advertising system in the world.
And it has far greater outreach
than most of the other companies.
Big school, whatever.
That's because of its search capabilities
and its obviously known popularity.
Its competitors are mainly from
different countries rather
than within the United States.
So it provides service to small and
mid-sized businesses and
doesn't change to meet customer needs,
because it's aiming at providing the best
advertising service that it can.
It innovates very rapidly,
which is if you're building your own
system on top of Google then you need
to accommodate that rapid innovation.
The value data for it,
Google is very good at creating real-time
data because it sees what people's needs
are through its advertising services.
And it sort of really capitalizes
on providing that in its services.
And has many different
service systems that
try to give you the best
updated data possible.
It champions the Cloud.
It's not into hybrid Clouds.
It doesn't want you to have
your own Google and then,
sort of upload them to a bigger Google.
It's trying to provide a Cloud that
everybody will use, which will
remove the necessity in a sense of
having your own local compute systems.
And it really works at the web scale,
the world wide web.
It's got an infrastructure that's global.
And it emphasizes things that will
work globally over the whole world.
One way to sum it up and
this is not my quote but
I think I got this from Gartner although
I'm not sure Gartner is responsible.
We're not like you and
you should want to be like us is sort of
almost the way that Google is
talking to the rest of the world.
So what it provides, its main emphasis is
a platform as a service although it does
offer now infrastructure as a service too.
So if you like it focused
on platform as a service,
because of its search and
so on, this was easy to do.
And then it introduced information
as a service sort of after thought
because Amazon was coming so
dominant and they needed to compete.
So with Google,
you have Google App Engine, and
the Google App Engine allows to you
code for Python, Java, and PHP and
Go it provides automatic auto-scaling.
And in some of the demos
that Google operate shows,
they show biogenetics,
genomics example for it.
So you can search from the web and
what they do is to scale
the size of the computation and
associate it with that from sort of a 1000
nodes up to 600000 nodes all
within Google app engine.
They have shared hardware
meaning that it's multi tenancy.
Multiple users use their
hardware at the same time.
Your Google App engine is actually sort of
time shared over multiple
different people.
You don't get a single CPU to yourself.
There is Cloud storage which is also
shared, that's its object store.
And then there's NoSQL Cloud data store,
which is this eventual
consistency data storage.
There's a MySQL relational
Cloud that you can use if
you want transactional based systems.
It offers Adobe Hadoop on top
of its systems, it offers
Cloud Pub/Sub based systems if
you want to do event processing.
So if you want events, then you publish
your events to the Google Cloud,
and people can subscribe and
listen to those events.
It provides cloud endpoints, allow you
to kind of connect clouds together.
And it allows business
analytics in the form of BAPAS.
So business analytics, platform as
a service, allowing you to do things like
Big Query and predictions on data sets.
So as you can see it has a broad range.
It's emphasis is much more
on platform as a service.
And its platformer service
isn't just sort of
one offering, it has multiple different
pieces because it's got Google Gmail
as another platform that it offers.
And it's really aiming at
the customer at the end user.
It does have infrastructures
as a Service as I said, and
under that is Google Compute Engine.
And the Google Compute Engine pretty much
allows you to do many of the things that
the Amazon services do,
but they don't have so
many ways to monitor and
to view the system and
so many options that terrific array
that we saw with Amazon of different
possibilities of the way you can
structure infrastructure as a structure.
Google has fewer of those.
One of the more impactful services that
Google does provide is part of the cloud
package are the following, it offers Maps.
Maps are used tremendously for
navigation, for all sorts of things.
Google maps is really one of the foremost
and it's taken to challenge things
like hezre which used to provide
mapping services in the past.
Is augmented maps with photographs and
really sort of detailed routing and so
this is provided a real sort of leader for
provider Google.
It also provides Translate using some
of the machine learning tools that
it's built.
It offers you to translate
from one language to another,
either written or oral.
It allows you form filling,
forms development.
It allows you wiki sites to do
all sorts of collaborations.
Allows you shopping,
which fits in with its marketing views.
And it also has Keep which is its way
of providing services to clients,
which one to remember, details about
the current state of their mobile.
So here's a sort of
splash screen of Google.
The Google compute engines got a nice,
nicely highlight here.
This is very a competitive market and
everybody is currently after trying to
get as much as that market as possible.
Google even with all of
the the platform as the service
offerings it is still being very
very competitive in information
has a service area and
covering it straight to make them match or
if not better than the other competitors
from Microsoft and of course from Amazon.
This is a description of what one of their
projects would look like if you go
into a information service, and
you can see here that you can go
build your particular services.
You can drill down to those and
elaborate them,
define them this is
the project dashboard for
the Google Services information
as a infrastructure service.
You can build a simple Hello World app.
You can try starting up virtual machines.
You can create APIs who are applications.
So you can build on the Google API
schemes to build your own APIs.
You can create cloud storage for
your systems.
You can go use their big
data collections and
you have a bunch of options just
like Microsoft and like Amazon.
You can go choose from a pre-built
solution with virtual machines and
various databases associated
with it to actually try and
put together your own type of cloud.
Here's a description.
Yes, we've got a populated instance here
where I've created a virtual machine.
And so
on the US central of Google environment,
and I'm talking to it with SSH,
and it has this IP address.
So I've skipped a few frames here, but
this is one of the displays that it
will offer you, showing you just how
computer engine can actually build
Cloud systems for customers.
