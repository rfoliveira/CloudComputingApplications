Economics really is
the foundation of cloud computing.
Cloud computing revolution really
started because people were considering
the costs involved in providing
computational facilities.
And whether there's
a better way to manage all
data center's computational
infrastructure, networks, everything.
We first look at utility pricing,
and later,
we will look at benefits of common
infrastructure in a different video.
This topic is based on a paper
by Joe Weinman, Cloudonomics.
And I suggest you take
to look at that as well.
There's more details in that paper and
more benefits explained.
We pick these two.
So, looking at the value
of utility pricing.
We want to explain why you
can have cloud services
that are more expensive than owning
your own infrastructure per hour or
per day, whatever, and
still be economical.
Let's look at an example.
Consider a car.
You can buy or lease a car for,
let's say, I don't know, $10 a day.
Number's not that important,
but let's say $10 a day.
And let's say, if you want to rent a car
for a day, it costs you $45 a day.
So, very obviously,
renting the car is more expensive
than owning the car, per day.
But let's say you go to a trip.
Let's say you take two days, and for
a vacation, and you go somewhere.
You don't buy a car over there.
You take an airplane trip.
And then you rent a car for
two days because buying wouldn't
make much sense over there.
So it totally depends on
the type of demand that you have
to figure out if it's more economical
to rent or buy a car or services.
So, let's look at this in
a little bit more detail.
We try to model this using
a simple mathematical model
and figure out how everything
is going to work out.
So let's say you have demand.
Demand is shown here by demand of t
that denotes that its demands per time.
One day you might have
a lot of computing demands,
another day your demands could go down.
We are looking at this for
a certain time period between 0 and
time capital T, let's say capital T is
I don't know, a whole year, 365 days.
During this time,
your demand goes up and down.
So P is the peak demand
during one day throughout
this 365 days,
your maximum demand we can denote by P.
What else do we have?
We can talk about the average demand,
you'll take
the mathematical mean of all
the demand during out the year.
B would be the baseline cost
of your computing unit.
So for example, a computer costs $10
a day, that would be your B here.
So that works, $10.
Therefore, what is B of T?
B of T would be the total cost of owning
infrastructure throughout the year.
And we will try to compute this value.
What about cloud costs?
Cloud unit cost is the cost of cloud
resources, say again, per day.
We want to compute what
is the total cost of
renting cloud computing
resources throughout the year.
Now finally, we have the utility premium,
which is defined as the ratio
of cloud cost over baseline cost.
So for example, if your cloud cost
is $45 then baseline cost is $10.
Your utility premium would be 4.5.
So, our mission here is
trying to find out the total
baseline cost per year, and total cloud
cost per year, and then comparing them.
Well, let's actually start
from total baseline cost.
This is easy.
If your demand goes up and
down, let's say this is your demand
throughout the year, and goes up and down.
You need to provide the services
to your customers every day.
And you don't go and
buy new machines every day.
So since this is your peak demand,
you need that many machines
throughout the year.
You need 200 machines.
That means that throughout the year
you need all of 200 machines
to be sitting there.
And that's actually really
the reason why we go through
to the argument of cloud computing.
But let's continue.
So the total cost of owning
would be the baseline cost,
multiplied by the time period, 365 days,
multiplied by how many machines
do you have, P, the maximum
number of machines that you need to
answer your workload for peak demand.
Now what about cloud cost?
For cloud cost,
it's actually a little bit more detailed.
You can very quickly yen.
Get and release resources from the cloud
provider as you demand goes up and down.
So now we can actually do an integration.
Integral of the cost of the cloud that's
actually you multiply by B,
just look at here.
Cloud cost is really you multiply by B.
And you do an integral over
time throughout the year
from the first day to the last day.
If you compute this,
you get less value for the cloud costs.
So now the question is, when is cloud's
going to be cheaper than owning?
CT less than BT.
If we substitute these values
that we just computed.
In this argument, we want to find
out when is A multiplied by U
multiplied by B multiplied by T, less
than P multiplied by B multiplied by T.
If you do the math, implies that
clouds are cheaper than baseline
when the utility premium is less than the
ratio of peak demand to average demand.
So if your workload is
very highly various,
goes up and at some point goes down and
goes up again and goes down,
say here your average is a certain
value and your peak is a certain value.
If the ratio of peak to average is more
than the utility premium that the cloud
provider is asking it becomes more
economical to use cloud computing.
So in real world that was
a simple mathematical model.
What about in real world?
So in real world and practice,
demands are often very spiky which
is good for cloud computing.
You have news stories coming in, something
happening, everybody's interested,
goes to their news website, tries to
find out, and then within a day or
two, nobody cares anymore.
The demand goes out.
Marketing promotions.
Manufacture wants to sell their things.
There's a one week, two week time period.
Everybody wants to use a certain sale,
and then the sale is done.
Product launch is the same thing.
Internet flash floods.
Your article or
blog somehow made it through /.website.
Everybody in the world comes and
checks out your blog and
you need to resources to
respond to that sort of demand.
And then within a few days
again that demand goes down.
Tax season,
everybody has to file taxes within
a certain time period throughout the year.
The rest of the year nobody
goes to that website.
So in reality, lots of demands are spiky.
Now often, a hybrid cloud computing
model provide the best advantage.
So going back to our car example,
in your own town,
you own a car, you use it for
your daily commute, go around.
Whenever you travel, you rent a car.
For example,
when you need to move from one house
to another house, you rent a van.
You don't own a van all the time.
Even in your own hometown.
So a key factor is really figuring
out the ratio of your peak demand to
the average demand that you have.
And own part of your computing
infrastructure yourself, for
your average demand, and
be able to move on to cloud computing and
providers whenever there is a need to.
Although of course,
I should mention here that itâ€™s not
very simple, as I just implied.
You should also consider
the network costs.
Because if you are providing a hybrid
model, you have to have a good network
that connects your infrastructure
to the cloud infrastructure.
You need to provide interoperability
between your own cloud and
the public cloud so
that might cost a little bit.
And of course, you need to
consider reliability requirements,
accessibility requirements that you have.
So it's a little bit more detailed but
what we see
today is that a lot of entities grow
towards hybrid cloud computing.
So to summarize, utility pricing is
good when demand varies over time.
As is the case for startup companies,
seasonal businesses, etc.
When utility premium is less than the
ratio of peak demands to average demand,
cloud computing is beneficial and
makes sense.
In the next video, we will look at
the possible savings on the other side for
the cloud providers that they can create
by using statistical multiplexing.
That's putting different jobs from
different customers together.
