There
are multiple reasons for cloud adoption.
Clouds allow economics.
They allow you to provide computing and
services to your users very inexpensively,
and they save you the problem
of building infrastructure.
But they also allow you to share things,
and
sharing data is a really
essential issue these days.
And there are all sorts
of reasons coming for
using that big data to provide
value to your company,
to provide value to science,
to provide value to medicine.
So, it's another round in innovation and
sole enabled
through virtualization,
cloud computing, big data.
That's going to provide a tremendous
economic boost, everyone benefits.
What does that mean for you?
Almost everybody will use cloud computing,
though you search,
video streaming, social networking,
just to name a few things.
IT specialists, in particular,
need to know about clouds,
when to outsource, how to build
applications and what its uses are.
There are different concerns about
how you architect the cloud.
How you share data.
Privacy.
Really crucial to all of this
is being able to program,
being able to program cloud apps,
use clouds effectively.
And efficiencies going to be the bottom
line because everybody's competing for
the best use and for the economy.
Everybody wants to use the scalability and
the parallelism of the cloud to
make their enterprises the fastest,
the best, whether it's in science or
business.
So, what about the general audience?
Why should you be interested
in cloud computing if
you're just a carpenter, or a whatever.
And the answer is,
this is really actually a revolution.
There is a general audience out there.
It's going to have a huge impact
on society, business, government.
It's going to give everyone from
your children up to retirees.
It's going to give
everyone a new capability.
A new way of viewing things.
A new way of looking at policies.
A new ways to communicate,
as shown by our social networks,
Facebook and Twitter, and so on.
And again, it has influence in other
areas like privacy and security.
What's next in our lectures.
While we're going to have a demonstration
that you're going to be doing this.
You're going to learn how
to write a web service,
it's going to be one of these
web servers that scales.
So you can use one, two, or however,
many web servers you want
to provide web service.
And we're going to use load
balancing to actually provide
a fair distribution over all
of the machines in the cloud
to serve those web requests you're
getting to your enterprise.
So at the end of that unit, you will have
confidence to actually being able to
approach a cloud and
use it to build a servers.
We're going to demonstrate that
application in the sense that
it's a fundamental user application on
the web because everybody like it or
not is going to access
the cloud over the web.
Then, we're going to
move to other lectures.
So we're going to talk about
software defined architecture,
how you build a cloud,
what is it's components essentially.
We’re going to talk about
management controls, billing,
software modules available.
We’re going to talk in general
about distributed computing, and
reliability, and parallelism.
Why distributed computing is so essential,
why it enabled clouds to be built.
And, then we're going to provide
insight to the power of sharing data,
what does that really mean?
So in summary, cloud computing,
it has four legs if you like,
one is economics, one is big data,
another is this move towards
taking cloud computing and
providing utility computing that
everybody can access across the globe.
And the last is improvise
a wealth of careers,
of new careers in a new technology
taking us in new directions.
