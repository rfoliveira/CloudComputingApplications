Salesforce is one of the main providers of
platform as a service.
Or should I say, software as a service.
It runs a complete sort of solution for
clients.
It also allows them to
build their own solution.
So there's a little bit of discussion,
platform as a service,
software as a service.
But nevertheless, what they have has
made this cloud computing their own,
from the point of view of
providing CRM Services,
that's customer relationship
management services to customers.
And in the past they actually
managed to displace major CRM
businesses with this style of approach
of providing a cloud that does that.
So they are now sort of moving into other
areas of cloud computing,
from that sort of basis.
So although it's not as well known and
sort of dominant as Amazon or Google,
nevertheless, this particular Salesforce
company is an example of how you can make
clouds really sort of a platform for
a whole new generation of innovation and
services.
So what they offer, sales,
service, marketing,
analytics, communities, and
lightning deployments of systems.
They offer this sort of very,
very flexible, very fast system for
basically companies providing facilities
that Microsoft didn't actually fulfill.
Microsoft's, much more in
the Office style support.
These guys are much more in the,
if you like, how
do you put a business network together
to make the business successful?
Whereas Office and Microsoft are working
on the back-end inside the office.
How does that all work together for
the accounting and so on?
So, you could think of this as
social software for the workplace.
They're competitor to Microsoft,
IBVM, Jive,
Salesforce obviously is
prime contender in that.
So, the idea is each business wants
to find out about each other,
and to build networking,
build professional connections.
They want to mine their networks for
contacts, acquaintances.
Get advice, references, referrals.
They're forming teams, business teams.
Different businesses
together in a team as well.
Communities in formal groups and
collaborate on particular work projects.
So CRM Services allow you to discuss and
comment on work, and
organize work from an individual
group perspective.
Identify relevant information.
Discover other people with common
interests, alert users to information,
learn from other users' expertise.
Salesforce uses Wave to build all this,
and they have
a Salesforce Analytics Cloud.
So from when Salesforce started,
what they provided was this platform
where you could piece together
various pieces of this service to provide
you with customer relationship management.
And they did it at a rate that was
very reasonable for companies.
And you could scale it.
As your company grew, you could build
a bigger customer relationship management
service, which allowed lots
of small businesses to start
up actually using CRM and
taking advantage of that networking
to start finding their
own way in business.
And it was so successful that
Salesforce became, if you like,
one of the leading flagships for
promoting cloud computing.
