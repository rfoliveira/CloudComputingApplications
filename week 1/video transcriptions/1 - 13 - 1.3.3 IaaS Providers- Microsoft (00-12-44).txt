So Microsoft is a challenger
in this race for
who's the biggest cloud vendor and
they certainly provide a huge cloud.
Their view is to put cloud and
mobile first before everything else.
They've always aimed at businesses,
and providing support for businesses.
And of course one of their benefits
they can do is to bring Office and
all of the Office software
to a very large audience.
To Office 365 on their cloud.
So let's look at their system,
what they provide.
They have emphasized trying to
build a competitive service.
They have even provided a competitive
way of doing virtualization as
provided by Hyper-V.
And the intention of course is not
to get locked into Vmware software.
And it distinguishes them
from what Amazon's doing.
Microsoft Azure has both infrastructure
as a service and platform as a service.
Their big selling,
marketing point is really the provision of
Office 365 and Office for
iPad on those services.
So that everybody who's accustomed to
actually using Microsoft for a business
can actually just move to a cloud solution
using whatever devices are available.
It also provides a shared file
system called SharePoint.
And that's another sort
of sales point because
they have a lot of
customs using SharePoint.
One of the claims that Microsoft makes
is that if you have a local business and
you've setup a computing environment
without networking, and your Office, and
all of the other different applications
in your Microsoft environment.
They will move that to the cloud for you
as a way if you expanding your business or
making your business cheaper.
They would do that and
you will retain all of the features and
connectivity and some customized
organization of that cloud.
And so you don't have to
really deal with very much.
It's all taken care of you moving to
that different sort of support system.
So they also provide some facilities
as platforms as a service.
Software as a service or rather.
They provide the Yammer which is
a social and collaboration network.
They provide Exchange which
is like Google's Gmail.
But it's a mail service and
their Exchange service is very large.
Now they're also providing
a voice over IP in the way of
a Skype version that Microsoft calls Lync,
but it's essentially Skype.
And they've amalgamated these things.
They also provide customer
relationship management and
theirs is a very dynamic system and
again that's been quite successful.
So it was launched by Microsoft in 2010.
And say it provides both
sets of types of services.
What it also accommodates Is
hybrid cloud computing, and that's
a really sort of interesting feature that
Microsoft has got itself into there.
What it allows you to do is to take your
local cloud and connect it to the bigger
Microsoft cloud, and
by doing that it allows you to scale up.
With Microsoft products of course,
it allows you to scale up to
a much bigger office system.
And you can keep a core, which is perhaps
more efficient, on your local machines.
But then if you need the extra capacity,
you can scale out with
hybrid cloud computing.
So that's a really interesting feature.
What can you use Azure for?
Well, pretty much you can use it for
anything.
All of the topics we discussed before
about bringing up virtual machines and
different virtual machines
you can use with the cloud.
In fact,
Azure will allow you to run Linux.
It will allow you to run any
other sort of Unix system or
one that you build yourself.
They're completely neutral
with respect to that.
Their cost provides you very,
very good Windows virtual machines.
The PaaS service has been known to host
websites that receive a lot of traffic.
They have a reputation for
being able to do that very well.
They have a lot of web building tools.
And so
that is a natural business area for them.
They also provide very
good .NET facilities.
And if you want to extend your .NET or
your .NET application to the cloud
then Azure is the way to go.
Azure developed their own operating system
called Windows Azure that is used for
their data center clusters.
And that does the glue to actually make
all of the Azure do what it's using.
Underneath our Windows Azure is a Hyper-V.
It's a Windows server Hypervisor
that can run virtual machines
of any different sort.
And your interface to that
Hyper-V would be Windows Azure.
The Windows server is supported.
So you can take your customized
environment that you've built in house.
And you can move it out
to the cloud very easily.
You can provision and
manage the virtual machines on it.
And you can attach and manage disks
on it just as if it was locally.
So this is a great way
of building a hybrid
cloud solution that is flexible.
And you can pay a base rate to keep it
going because you're going to use that
100% of the time.
And then when you get peak loads,
like at Christmas,
you can just get more of
your system from Azure.
So Azure as I was saying, was
the operating system in the data center.
It treats the whole data
center as the machine.
Handles the resource management.
Provisioning, monitoring,
manages application life cycle.
Allows developers to concentrate
on business logic in their own
operating systems,
their own systems that they're building.
So for example it provides a shared
pool of compute disk and network.
It provides that virtualized storage,
that compute and
networking the illusion
of boundless resources.
That's all sort of mapped into
the Windows Azure operating system,
which is really sort of
a distributed operating system that
manages all the components through those
Hypervisors that we've been talking about.
It provides common building blocks for
distributed application.
Reliable queuing,
simple structured storage, SQL storage,
and then access control and connectivity.
And the Windows access control
systems are quite sophisticated.
They're like the ones that you get for
your local clusters.
So they provide a very, very sort of tight
security system that you can use and
deploy as long as you are familiar
with how Windows does its security.
So here's some of the components
that we see in the Azure
you have your service model,
then you have .NET.
You have ASP which is used for the web.
You have PHP.
Then there's underneath that,
Windows 2008 services.
You have your Hypervisor,
your Blades, your SQL and storage.
Blob, Queue, Table.
Blobs like objects in Amazon,
there is configuration for networking.
And so what you see in this, although
the names are different, exact sort of.
Duplication of many of
the things that Amazon is doing
because all these big cloud systems
need the same management tools.
So a cloud application's typically made
up of lots of different components.
It will have a front end,
load balancing stateless web servers.
It'll have a middle worker tier, which is
sort of order processing and encoding.
And you would get to that middle
worker tier through the front end.
You would have a back end
storage with SQL tables and
files to actually drive this thing.
Multiple instances of each for
scalability and availability.
And what Azure does is to provide you
a model of these cloud applications,
so you can pick one and
then you can instantiate different
pieces of it in ways that you want.
So this modeling sort of allows
you to get simple workflows.
Allows you to build simple
systems by using very,
very sophisticated pieces of components.
And some quite sophisticated
algorithms in terms of load balancing.
So their terminology
is slightly different.
Their application is called a service.
They provide a definition for
that service,
so a way to describe your service using,
I think it's XML defined information.
They allow you to describe
the configuration information
in a scripting way so
that it can be stored and retrieved.
And roles for
what things are doing inside the system.
Roles like DLLs in the service process.
They're collections of code with an entry
point that runs its own virtual machine.
And so you see different terminology but
very similar purposes backed with
some between Amazon and Microsoft.
There's three role types that they offer.
One's a sort of ASP.NET II57,
sort of Windows Azure
supplied operating system.
They provide a worker role.
Arbitrary code in a Windows
supplied operating system.
They provide a VM role uploaded
with VHD provided by the customer.
So this will be your heavyweight.
Heavy duty, very customized,
very special purpose type of systems.
So they provide different service
models for what they're providing.
Slightly different from the Amazon stuff,
but still satisfying
the need of providing
those CPU classifications.
This is what the role contents look like.
There's a way for naming it.
There's a description of the size,
the VM, small, medium, large.
So you can see different ways to
organize things, from Amazon to here.
They have code, Web/Worker Role,
Hosted DLL, and so on.
Different types of code
that you can embed.
And different configurations, number of
instances, number of threads, and so on,
number of updates, and fault domains, so
that you can keep track of your systems.
Again, it's very similar in sort
of function to what Amazon is.
Very different organization according to
a Microsoft way of viewing everything.
Both accomplishing the same task.
And of course both vying to get customers
to actually use their system, and
trying to make their systems as simple
as possible to use, for the purpose of
providing the services that customers
want to provide to their clients.
